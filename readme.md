# Switch N' Play Site Redesign

This is the ReadMe for the Switch N' Play drag collective website redesign.
The current site is [www.switchnplay.com] The test site can be viewed here: [https://mermatriarchy.github.io/switch-n-play/index]

The goal of this redesign is to make a cleaner, mobile-friendly version of the site.
Strategically, the end goal(s) would be for traffic to the site to result in an increase 
in show attendance, and a straight-forward way to contact the group for press coverage
and/or performer connections/networking.

I didn't use a framework for the front-end functionality, which I now deeply regret because
making it responsive was pretty labor-intensive, but I did learn a lot about media queries 
and the overall the load time of the site is great. I decided not to use a framework mainly 
because it seemed a little heavy-handed for a site that was only 6 pages total. So overall
it was a good learning experience, though I don't know if I'd try to build something like this
from scratch again.

##Release 2
As of 12/24/2016, the site is ready to be published, pending photo approval and performer bio
additions (and finalizing the TOC). There are a few other ideas I had to improve the site after the initial launch.

###Additional Features
- Adding some of Fuschia's performance photos to the photo galleries 
- Adding forward/backward arrows to the photo galleries 
- Adding a contact form that people could fill out to apply to perform in Moxie
- Further researching ways to incorporate SnP's Instagram feed into the site.
